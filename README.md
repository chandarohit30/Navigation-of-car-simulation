# Navigation-of-car-simulation

Developed a car navigation and control system utilizing Mobile Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics for position and orientation tracking, ensuring efficient movement toward the target destination with obstacle avoidance.

Implemented the Vector Field Histogram (VFH) algorithm, leveraging range sensor data to compute obstacle-free driving directions, enhancing the robot's ability to navigate and avoid obstacles in real-time.

Used PyBullet for simulation, integrating CarPos, turn_angle, and CarOrn to control the car's position, turning angle, and orientation, allowing seamless interaction within a physics-based environment.

Applied Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks to improve the VFH algorithm, ensuring more reliable navigation and obstacle avoidance by learning from the environment and adapting in real-time.

Designed car control and navigation functions with Python and implemented key functions to handle car position updates, orientation control, and sensor readings for dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance.

Utilized PyBullet for physics-based simulation and vector field histogram-based steering decisions, allowing the car to adapt to various environmental conditions and navigate from the start point ([0,0]) to the target ([9,-9]) with minimal human intervention.
